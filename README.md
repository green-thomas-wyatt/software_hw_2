Hello Dr. Horn, welcome to my amazing HW_2.

I have exported the SQL file and it is in the repository. In order to start the web app, you will need to use this file to create and populate the database.
You will likely need to edit the connection.js file in the database folder with your own credentials so you can connect to the database properly. 

Once this is done, please create a new folder and pull all of the code within the repository, using a git clone command, or just download these files manually, up to you.

When this is done, on whatever IDE you are using, create a new terminal, and run the command 'npm start', this will start the server on your machine.

Once this is done, open the web browser of your choice, and go to the following web address "http://localhost:3000/". This will take you to the home page, with my favorite food,
and cooking experience.

You can navigate around the pages using the buttons at the top left of the screen, and you can check out some existing recipes of mine, or you can create your own using the ingredients of my
current recipes. 

When you add a recipe, it will appear on the recipe list, dynamically increasing depending on what category you put it in.

You can also click on any existing recipe and check out what ingredients it has and a description of it.
I suggest you hover over the ingredients when you click on a recipe, it is pretty cool and took me longer than I would like to admit :D.

I hope you enjoy this amazing cooking website, if you have any questions, issues, or comments, please let me know!
